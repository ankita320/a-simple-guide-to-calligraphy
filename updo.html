  Up Strokes

  When you are doing up and down strokes you need to focus on the side of the pen you are using. When you are doing an upstroke, make sure to use the top point of the marker. Carefully create an upstroke by dragging the marker up across the page. The picture shown below is how this should be done. When doing an upstroke do not push down on the tip so much as it would create a thicker line. Draw the upstroke lightly without any pressure which would factor into giving it the thinner look. Keep on practicing, and remember the key is lightly with no pressure!

  Down Strokes
  </h1>
<div class= "updooo">
  <div>

  When you are doing the down stroke, use the wider part od the marker. Use the side of your pen to do the down stroke. Carefully, drag a thick line down for a downstroke. When doing this, do now be afraid to bend the marker down. It is even better when bending the marker down because you can get a better sense of control. As you see on the picture to the right, there is a clear sense of control in the "with pressure" picture than the one without. Be sure do put in more pressure on the pen as you are drawing the downstroke. This is important to give the calligraphy the nice look. Keep on practicing your down stroke until you are happy with it. Remember, the key is pressue, bend the marker down as much as you would like but oviously don't break it!
