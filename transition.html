   Now that you have figured out how to do the first basic strokes in calligrapy it is time to learn the other 5 strokes that will guide you to lettering. The key to this is about keeping the momemtum as you did your first two strokes and being able to transition from one side to the next. A picture of all 6n strokes are in the image below.</p>

<h2 class= "intro2">Transitioning</h2>
   <p class= "intro3">
   Transitioning is often one of the more difficult things to do when practicing calligraphy. However, it is actually quite simple as you start to practice it more and more. When transitioning from an upstroke to a downstroke, drag your pen from the tip slowly to the side of the pen when. When you are going down fro the upstroke your pen will automatically start to transition when held in the same position. The same is for when transitioning from a downstroke to an upstroke. The only difference is that when going back up, to not use the side but rather the tip of the pen.</p>

   <p class= "horse">
    This transition is a downward-upward curve. What you do here is you start from the top with a downstroke. Keep the pressure and bend down the side of the pen. As you make your way down, changing from the side of the pen, transition to using the tip of the pen. From there curve upwards. Make the upstroke with little pressure. Keep on practicing to get your best result. Now... you've already learned 3/7th of calligrapy! </p>

<div>
   <p class= "horse">
    This transition is the opposite of downward-upward curve. It is the upward-downward curve. What you do here is you start from the top with an upstroke. Keep light pressure and drag your pen up the page. As you make your way up, changing from the side of the pen, transition to using the side of the pen. From there curve downwards.  Transitioning/going down, be sure to use pressure and bend down the side of the pen. Keep on practicing to get your best result. Now... you've already learned 4/7th of calligrapy! </p>

                </div>
<div>
   <p class= "horse">
    This transition is a loop down. What you do here is you start off with an upstroke and curving it into a loop upwards. The loop should go counterclockwise. When you draw it to the top of the loop transition from the tip of the pen to the side moving into a downstroke.Keep the pressure and bend down the side of the pen.  Keep on practicing to get your best result. Now... you've already learned 5/7th of calligrapy! </p>

     This transition is a loop up. What you do here is you start off with a downstroke and go down. Keep pressure and bend down the pen. As you go down a bit more, transition from the side of the pen to the tip of the pen. Doing that, transition upards into a curved loop. the loop should go clockwise closing to the downstroke. Keep on practicing to get your best result. Now... you've already learned 6/7th of calligrapy!</p>

   <p class= "horse">
    This transition is a circle. What you do here is you start from the top with a downstroke but this time start from somewhere middle and curve the downstroke a little bit. Keep the pressure and bend down the side of the pen. As you make your way down, changing from the side of the pen, transition to using the tip of the pen. From there curve upwards and connect to tthe top from where you started. Make the upstroke with little pressure. Keep on practicing to get your best result. Now... you've already learned 7/7th of calligrapy! </p>
