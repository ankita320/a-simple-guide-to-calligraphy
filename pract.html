  <h1> Practice!</h1>
  <p>The best way to learn calligrapy is to PRACTICE. This sounds very clique but trust me, it is so worth it. No matter what you learn, you have to practice. That is how you will improve and make progress. This may sound tiring now, but when you continue to progress and get to your best results, you will see how much simply practicing brought you along the way. This is how you can perfect your skills. It doesn't have to be hours and hours everyday. You can sit down, and simply take 15 minute from your day to practice. It doesn't have to be a whole hour but even just 10-15 minutes a day can make lots of progress. Just remember to practice consistently. Even if you don't it everyday, be consisent so you make make the most progress. Here below is a picture of my calligraphy before and now.</p>
