<p class= "intro">When learning calligraphy, you start to pick up on a style- a style of your own; a style that says YOU. However, sometimes it is hard to find that style. Sometimes when you are learning calligraphy, you focus too much on trying to find a style and don't get to improve your calligraphy. Here, I will be guiding you on how to find styles and what to do when you are stuck. </p>

<p class= "intro1">
   • When you are learning calligraphy, you need to start off somewhere right? Right now you don't have to worry about finding the perfect style. That magic happens as you are improving calligraphy. Try starting off with something simple and not too complicated. It is best to stick with a simple style for now because you are still in the process of learning calligraphy and you may still be struggling with your a's or b's The style shown below is a great starter style you can stick too. Obviously, that is optional. Start with a simple style that is most comfortable for YOU.</p>
