<p class= "bazic"> These are some of my favorites when trying out calligrapy. These are set up into how advanced of a stage you are at in calligrapy. Look through and have fun!</p>
<h1 class= "lettt">Beginner</h1>
<div class= "lettt"><h2>Crayola/Other Basics</h2>
<p>The best beginner pen I would recommend starting off with are basic broadline markers like crayola. There are many other knockoff or markers like the tip shown down below. This is perfect because you are just starting to learn calligrapy and with the slight bendability as well as a point at the top, you are still able to practice like with a real calligrapy pen. I would not recommend using real modern calligrapy pens now because it will be a lot more difficult and may even unmotivate you to learn.  </p>

<h1 class=  "lett">Intermediate</h1>
<div class= "lett"><h2>Brush Pens!</h2>
<p>You can start moving up to brush pens now! WOOOO!! Some things to keep in mind however is that to not get expensive name brand ones YET. Even though you have MASTERED using crayola and markers as such, moving to brush pens is still a big transition because it is more flexible. So I would say to start off on the cheaper side before moving up to pens like tombow or ecoline.  </p>

<h1 class=  "lettttttt">Advanced</h1>
<div class= "lettttttt"><h2>Experimenting</h2>
<p>By now you've probably been practicing for a while to get to your best level. Now since you are mastering calligrapy go ahead and try experimenting! You can try using watercolor brushes, maybe other art materials and seeing if you can turn that into calligrapy, anything! You can try about a multitude of different things and experiment! The options are endless </p>
